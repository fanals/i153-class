	    					<h3>The Bouchons of Lyon</h3>
	    					<p>Lyon is France's gastronomic capital. A preeminence that almost certainly stems from its privileged geography.<br>
							<br>
	    					At the moment, the Guide Michelin scatters a total of 13 stars around the city and its immediate vicinity, with many more within 50 miles or so. However, good eating in Lyon is by no means necessarily Michelin starred, a fact vividly illustrated by the city's unique bouchons, the tiny, animated, artless places that keep the basic culinary traditions of Lyon alive.<br>
							<br>
	    					Bouchons are bistros of a sort, but with even more limited menus. Their decor tends to be modest to the point of austerity. Some have paper tablecloths, and some don't change the cutlery between courses but the food and ambience of any good bouchon will warm the coldest heart.<br>
